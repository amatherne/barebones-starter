          In 2022, 100% reached out to my agency for some help with their site.
          They were already on Shopify but there were a lot of issues with their
          current site. My team was tasked with giving them a 1-to-1 remake of
          their current site. Though had a massive amount of product and pages,
          all with individual sections and content, we were able to turn their
          new site around within 2 months.

          Maximizing 100%'s online visibility was a top priority. I implemented
          robust hierarchies, accurate attributions, structured data, and other
          SEO techniques to optimize each page. This comprehensive strategy
          ensured that the brand's sports and performance gear was effortlessly
          discoverable by search engines and potential customers alike.

          Ensuring accessibility and ethical standards were top priorities for
          100%. Regular audits were performed to guarantee that the website met
          ADA compliance requirements, addressing elements like image alt text,
          attribute titles, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation. This
          dedication to accessibility provided an inclusive online experience
          for all users.

          100%'s stellar marketing team was always coming up with amazing new
          designs and ideas, and it was my job to make them a reality. Every

          their brand.

          100%'s dynamic nature demanded that their website continually adapt to
          their marketing,  product shifts and new brand ambassadors. I managed
          the site’s updates for major events such as Black Friday, Cyber
          Monday, Memorial Day, and clearance sales. This included configuring
          daily themes, creating time-sensitive product bundles, setting up
          countdown timers, and implementing popups for limited-time offers.

          eeping up with the latest Shopify and third-party apps was vital for

          managing app integrations and troubleshooting, collaborating closely
          with tools such as Klaviyo, Yotpo, and Rebuy. My responsibilities
          included coordinating with third-party development teams to address
          and resolve issues, ensuring smooth integration and optimal
          performance.
