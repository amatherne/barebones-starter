          of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

          You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! The
          plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. I want to come with
          you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the
          ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

          Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. The Force is strong with this
          one. I have you now. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I
          call it luck. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the
          responsibility yourself.

          Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
          The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of
          the Force. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star
          systems will slip through your fingers.

          No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Kid,
          I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot
          of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe
          there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no
          mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of
          simple tricks and nonsense.
