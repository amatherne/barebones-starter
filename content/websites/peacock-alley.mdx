        text: >
          In 2019, my agency was contracted to rebuild Peacock Alley's eCommerce
          platform, and I was assigned as the Lead Developer for the project.
          Starting from Shopify's Debut theme, I created a completely
          customizable platform. I continued in this role for over five years.
          In 2022, Peacock Alley sought a brand refresh, prompting a second
          rebuild using Shopify's new Dawn theme. These rebuilds encompassed
          thousands of products, hundreds of blog posts, and dozens of landing
          pages.

        text: >
          Peacock Alley values uniqueness, and I was dedicated to helping them
          achieve it. I developed dozens of customizable sections used across
          all pages and templates, tailored to specific requirements like tags,
          metafields, types, and collections. For example, there was a Slider
          with full control over text color, placement, size, overlay color,
          slide-specific custom CSS, and height adjustments based on screen
          size.

          Ensuring Peacock Alley's content was fully indexed and searchable was
          paramount. I implemented correct hierarchies, attribution, schemas,
          and other best practices to optimize every page for search engines.
          This meticulous approach ensured that the brand's luxury home textiles
          were easily discoverable online.

          Access and ethics are as important to me as they are to Peacock Alley.
          Regular audits were conducted to confirm full accessibility for all
          users, covering aspects like image alt text, attribute titles, ARIA
          text, and keyboard functionality. This commitment to ADA compliance
          ensured an inclusive experience for everyone.

        text: >
          Peacock Alley's dynamic nature required their website to reflect their
          ever-changing marketing and product offerings. For over five years, I
          was the go-to person for events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday,
          Memorial Day, and Last in Inventory Sales. This involved setting up
          daily themes, short-time product bundles, countdown timers, and
          limited-time popups.

          Staying current with the latest Shopify and third-party apps was
          crucial for success. I acted as the internal liaison for app
          installations and troubleshooting, working with apps like Klaviyo,
          Yotpo, Rebuy, and BOLD. My role often involved brainstorming and
          resolving issues with third-party development teams to ensure seamless
          integration and functionality.
