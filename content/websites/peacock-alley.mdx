          In 2019, my agency was contracted to rebuild their eCommerce platform,
          and I was assigned as the Lead Developer for the project. Starting
          from Shopify Debut theme, we created an entire new customizable
          platform for them. I would remain in the Lead position for this client
          for the next 5+ years.


          In 2022 Peacock Alley decided they were ready for a brand refresh so
          we did a second rebuild, but this time using Shopify's new Dawn theme.
          All told both rebuilds covered thousands of products, hundreds of blog
          posts, and dozens of landing pages.

          Peacock Alley loves to keep things unique. And I loved to help them do
          it. They had dozens of different sections that were used across all
          pages and templates. Sometimes these could be single instance setups
          for a homepage, or a section that only shows if that specific Product
          has the correct info. Sometimes that info was: Tags, Metafields,
          Types, Collections, you name it I used it as a filter. 


          For instance, I built custom Hero sections where each slide gave full
          control over text color, placement, size, overlay color, slide
          specific custom css, and even a ways to control the height of the
          slider based on multiple screen size options.

          As a distinguished name in luxury home textiles, it was important to
          make sure every page and word was indexed and searchable anywhere. We
          focused on correct hierarchies, attribution, schemas, and other best
          practices to ensure nothing was missed along the way.

          Access and ethics are as important to me as they are to Peacock Alley.
          Every few months an audit would be conducted to confirm that nothing
          was inaccessible for any user, no matter how they browsed. This
          covered things like Image Alt Text, Attribute Titles, Aria Text, and
          Keyboard functionality.

          Peacock Alley is a dynamic and ever-changing business. Everyday their
          site needed to reflect the marketing and products they offered. I was
          their on-hand guy for every Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Memorial Day,
          and Last in Inventory Sale for 5+ years. This involved setting up
          daily themes, short time product bundles, countdown timers, and
          limited time popups.

          It's impossible to get anywhere in today's market if you're not up to
          date with the most current Shopify and other 3rd party apps. Including
          names like Klaviyo, Yotpo, Rebuy, BOLD, and many more. I routinely
          acted as the internal liaison for Peacock Alley during app installs or
          when something wasn't working as expected. Often having to brainstorm
          and troubleshoot issues with 3rd party dev teams.
