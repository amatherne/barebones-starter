[First things first, take a look at this site's **Github repo**!](https://github.com/amatherne/barebones-starter)

For the past 7+ years, I've immersed myself deeply in the Shopify ecosystem. As a Senior Developer at a Shopify Plus Agency, I had the opportunity to create hundreds of exceptional eCommerce experiences. However, the fast-paced environment and high-quality demands of agency work left little room for me to explore and spend time with other technology stacks.

When it came time to build a new portfolio site, I decided to step outside my comfort zone and dive into React and Next.js. Starting with the [Barebones Starter](https://github.com/tinacms/tina-barebones-starter) code from [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/), I built the entire platform from scratch, learning along the way. This journey allowed me to develop a robust platform that includes multiple custom content pipelines for blog posts, websites, and musicâ€”some of which are still in development. I also created reusable components, such as Hero sections and CTAs, that can be deployed across various pages.

Additionally, I built an integrated SVG and IMG system that automatically optimizes, resizes, and generates size-specific variants to ensure optimal load speeds whenever media is uploaded to the CMS, whether on the live site or locally.

While I still have much to learn about React and Next.js, this experience has been incredibly rewarding. I'm excited to continue expanding my knowledge and applying these new skills to my future work with Shopify.
